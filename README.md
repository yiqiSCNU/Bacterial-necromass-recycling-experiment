# Bacterial-necromass-recycling-experiment
Code repository: Bacterial necromass recycling promotes diversity maintenance in bacterial communities via resource partitioning

This repository contains R script used to analyze data in the manuscript:  
"Bacterial necromass recycling promotes diversity maintenance in bacterial communities via resource partitioning" (Manuscript in preperation)  


R scripts are organized into four directories:  

### 1. Necromass Combination Experiment  
- **Description**: Alpha and beta diversity analyses of bacterial communities in the necromass combination experiment.  


### 2. Assembly Rule Analyses  
- **Description**: Null model testing of assembly rules for common/rare taxa across seven thresholds and comparisions with 999 permutations.  

### 3. Species-Rich Necromass Experiment  
- **Description**: Alpha and Beta diversity patterns in species-rich necromass experiment.  

### 4. Metabolomic Data Analyses  
- **Description**: Metabolomic profiling for (1)12 single species necromass midum (2) mixed medium of 12 species necromass (3) spent medium of each of the 12 species culturing in mixed medium.
