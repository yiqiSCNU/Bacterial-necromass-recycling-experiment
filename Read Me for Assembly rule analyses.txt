This code package contains code and results for assembly rules analyses, 
examining two components:

(1) Trends in the number of lost/preserved/emergent species along NPS gradient
(2) Declining trends in average niche breadth/overlap along NPS gradient

For each component, analyses are performed on 

(i)  The full dataset
(ii) Data partitioned by a common/rare species, across seven thresholds

      threshold1: 1%
      threshold2: 0.5%
      threshold3: 0.2%
      threshold4: 0.1%
      threshold5: 0.05%
      threshold6: 0.02%
      threshold7: 0.01%

For each analysis, firstly read in the observed data (data were provided), 
then implemented null model analyses with treatment-level permutations 
(swapping treatment labels while preserving non-random species abundance distribution across treatments).

Output structure for each analysis contains 1,000 rows per threshold

Row 1: Calculated metrics for observed data at the corresponding threshold,
Rows 2¨C1000: Results from 999 randomized permutation null models.
